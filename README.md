A context aware tool for proteasomal cleavage predictions


## About
`pepsickle` is an open-source command line tool for  proteasomal cleavage prediction. `Pepsickle` is designed with flexibility in mind allows for the use of either direct amino acid input or the `FASTA` files. Predictions can also be determined based on a variety of available models including those trained on: *in-vivo* epitope data (default), *in-vitro* constitutive proteasome data, or *in-vitro* immunoproteasome data. For information on available models and how they were trained, see the [companion paper in *XXXX*] highlighting this tool, as well as the accompanying [paper repo] with code for training and reproduction.
